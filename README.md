# neilbipat.github.io: My Portfolio!!!

### About 

This is my first time making a portfolio from scratch. 

---

### Tools Used

    - HTML(5 files)
    - CSS(5 files and 1 note files)
    - JavaScript(3 files)

### NOTE

    - My JavaScript files only have 3 because Pixel.html, Superhero.html, Weather.html only need to use the Weather.js
    - index.html and script.js are made for each other
    - Academa.js and Academia.html are made for each other since Academia has more pictures then the rest
    - In my CSS folder I have the txt file there because I like to make notes or certain observations that I think are important while creating 

----

### Acomplishments 

    - Creating my first website that is deployed
    - Learning how to make a modal 
    - The website is responsive

----

### RoadBlocks that will be tackled in the future

    - While it is responsive and works on Google Chrome, it does not work properly on your phone if you are using Safari and did not test other browsers
